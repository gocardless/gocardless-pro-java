/**
 * Represents a mandate import entry resource returned from the API.
 *
 * Mandate Import Entries are added to a [Mandate Import](#core-endpoints-mandate-imports).
 * Each entry corresponds to one mandate to be imported into GoCardless.
 * 
 * To import a mandate you will need:
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Identifying information about the customer (name/company and address)</li>
 *   <li>Bank account details, consisting of an account holder name and
 *      either an IBAN or <a href="#appendix-local-bank-details">local bank details</a></li>
 *   <li>Amendment details (SEPA only)</li>
 * </ol>
 * 
 * We suggest you provide a `record_identifier` (which is unique within the context of a
 * single mandate import) to help you to identify mandates that have been created once the
 * import has been processed by GoCardless. You can
 * [list the mandate import entries](#mandate-import-entries-list-all-mandate-import-entries),
 * match them up in your system using the `record_identifier`, and look at the `links`
 * fields to find the mandate, customer and customer bank account that have been imported.
 * 
 * <p class="restricted-notice"><strong>Restricted</strong>: This API is currently
 * only available for approved integrators - please <a href="mailto:help@gocardless.com">get
 * in touch</a> if you would like to use this API.</p>
